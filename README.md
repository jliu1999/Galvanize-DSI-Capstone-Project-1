# Galvanize-DSI-Capstone-Project-1

This is just a proposal waiting to be apprvoed.

## Proposal 1
**Covid-19 and Mask Usage**

The datasets can be found on 
https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv
and 
https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv

The first is the data of the covid-19 cases and deathes of all states up to now. The second one is about the mask use by county in the US until July 2020. I plan to combine these two datasets and try to answer the question: is mask wearing really help with preventing the SARS-CoV2 infection?

H0 will be that wearing mask will not affect the infection rate.

HA is that it does affect the infection rate.

Alternatively I can use the most recent survey data here: https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/export/?signalType=value&mode=overview&sensor=fb-survey-smoothed_wearing_mask

## Proposal 2
**World Health Statistics 2020|Complete|Geo-Analysis**

Dataset source:
https://www.kaggle.com/utkarshxy/who-worldhealth-statistics-2020-complete
 
I plan to use these four datasets: lifeExpectancyAtBirth.csv, population10%SDG3.8.2.csv, population25%SDG3.8.2.csv, medicalDoctors.csv 
I'd like to establish a possible link between the life expectancy and health care expenditures per househol,  and medical doctors per capita.


## Proposal 3
**Where it Pays to Attend College**

Here is a dataset about salaries by college, region, and academic major:

For those parents like ourselves who have children entering the colleges, it worths exploring the data and see what kind of colleges and majors will pay off .
